		<h1>Welcome to Cheetyr</h1>
		<p class="lede">A handy collection of cheat sheets and shortcuts to speed up the work of designers and developers.</p>
		<p>This project is very much a work in progress, and I hope in time to make it as comprehensive as possible. If you are interested in helping it grow, or just have a little feedback, please <a href="http://williamleeks.com/contact.php">get in touch</a> or get involved on <a href="https://github.com/WilliamLeeks/Cheetyr">GitHub</a>.</p>
		<p>At present, where shortcuts vary by operating system, the shortcuts on this site are for the Mac version of the software in question.</p>
